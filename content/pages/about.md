Hello there,

I'm __Isman Firmansyah__, a freelance _software developer_ from Indonesia (UTC+7).

I have experience developing social networks, messaging platforms, DevOps tools, and general web apps.
I also love collaborating on [open source projects][github] and occasionally giving [talks][speakerdeck] at local and/or regional events.

Over the years, I've worked with various companies such as [8villages][], Beautiplan, and SixReps.
Currently I'm working with [Gluu][gluu] to develop deployment tools for clustered servers
on top of `docker` technology and its ecosystem.

Oh by the way, you can reach me via [email][], [LinkedIn][linkedin], or [Twitter][twitter].
