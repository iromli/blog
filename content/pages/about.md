Hello there,

I'm **Isman Firmansyah**, a __[software engineer][github]__ and
occasional [meetup][meetup] __[speaker][speakerdeck]__ from Indonesia.
Previously worked at a software house/agency and various local startups (SixReps, Beautiplan).

Software engineering is what I'm focusing on right now,
but i __do__ have interests for other things, e.g. history and culture of mankind.
Also I'm quite active in tech community as a [Python Indonesia][python-id]
and [Docker Jakarta][docker-id] co-organizer.

If we haven't met in person, drop me a line or two on [Twitter][twitter] or [LinkedIn][linkedin].
