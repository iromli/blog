## A Farewell Note

> But I know this. We're ready to move forward again in our way. Together or apart, no matter how far apart, we live in one another. We go on together.

Almost a year ago, the majority of people who built SixReps were joining [Beautiplan][beautiplan] team.
As you can see, Beautiplan has its [lite][lite], [mobile web][mobile], and [Android][android] version.
I've been involved in those apps although I didn't contribute any code at all.
I was a member of their backend engineering team â€” my primary role was to maintain internal API,
log aggregation, error reporting, etc.

I hate to say goodbye, but at the end of this month, I will no longer work for Beautiplan.
It's a tough decision, but I have to move on as my interests have been shifted and I'm pursuing something else.

Thanks to everyone at Beautiplan. Lovely people, joyful moments.
