## The World Cup Saga

__Estadio Mineirao, Belo Horizonte__ — 15720.38 km/9768.19 miles from Indonesia —
Germany knocked down Brazil with stunning scoresheet, 7 - 1.
An embarassing moment for Brazil as a 5 times world champion and World Cup host.

As a football fan, I really enjoy how Germany played and won the game.
But that's not what makes me happy.
Instead, I like how both parties trying to comfort each others.
This is what I called EMPHATY.
We're human beings, we're embracing __HUMANITY__ above all.

Now, hold your breath! We're going to the other side of this world,
where people start their days with real fights.

## The Far East Saga

__Gaza, Palestine__ — 8735.73 km/5428.13 miles from Indonesia — was under attack (again) by Israelis
with their "Operation Protective Edge".

According to various sources (yes, I read western and eastern media as well),
the conflict escalated after 3 Israel kids were [kidnapped and murdered by Hamas][1].
Afterwards, a Palestinian kid named Mohammed Abu Khdeir [kidnapped and burned alive][2] by Israelis.
Some said, it's an "eye for an eye" act.
Well, I think both parties were doing mistake by killing innocent civilians.

As you might have guessed, the conflict got worse. Israel claimed that [Hamas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas)
fired rockets towards their cities. Hence Israel deployed their heavy force and assaulted Gaza.

Thanks God, as human beings we still have __EMPHATY__ and care about __HUMANITY__.

## Who's Who

By the time I write this blog post, the World Cup saga is still going on and Gaza is still under fire.
Now the question is who's the winner? Who's the loser?

Deep down my heart, I hope __HUMANITY__ will always be the winner and will never be the loser.
