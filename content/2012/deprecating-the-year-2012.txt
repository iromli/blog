## From 2012, With Love

### Things I've Learnt

During this year, i spend my days on building web services and console scripts -- less HTML, quirkey JavaScript, and CSS i have to care about. Most of the time, terminal is my truly beloved friend. Here's the screenshot of it:

* [git](http://git-scm.com/){: target="_blank"} CLI with custom [config](https://github.com/iromli/dotfiles/blob/master/_gitconfig)
* [ViM](http://www.vim.org/){: target="_blank"} with Twilight colorscheme
* [HTTPie](https://github.com/jkbr/httpie){: target="_blank"} with ``monokai`` theme

### People I've Met

![Python ID](/img/minipycon-2012.jpg){: class="thumbnail"}

Python Indonesia meetup at Detik, and it was fun!! We share knowledge, insight, almost anything about Python and the community itself.

[Blaast](http://www.blaast.com/) Indonesia representatives visited SixReps HQ.
They gave a talk about their platform, cloud mobile, and a little bit of NodeJS.

My first hackathon event -- 48 hours, hundreds of developers, cold weather, lovely city Bandung.

## Roadmap For 2013 (And Beyond)

> Only the dead have seen the end of war.

Well, that's what Plato said. But it's true. I have many things i want to achieve:

* Improve my Python knowledge.
* I have things for concurrency so i will learn programming language designed for it ([Go](http://golang.org/){: target="_blank"} or [Elixir](elixir-lang.org){: target="_blank"} is promising).
* Learn [LessCSS](http://lesscss.org/){: target="_blank"} and [Iced CoffeeScript](maxtaco.github.com/coffee-script/) -- a variant of [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/){: target="_blank"} with coroutine in mind.
* Be a better man.

Goodbye 2012, howdy 2013 ...
